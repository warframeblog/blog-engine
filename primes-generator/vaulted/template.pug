p Hey guys. And the #[strong #{primedItem} Prime] along with #{alongWith[0]} Prime and #{alongWith[1]} Prime have been retired(vaulted) from the Warframe reward tables.

h2 #{primedItem} Prime Vaulted
p Now, if you've joined fairly recently there's a pretty good chance you have never experienced the vaulting. So, what it did is remove the relics that would drop parts for the #{primedItem} Prime from the drop table. So, currently #{primedItem} Prime is inaccessible for some period of time. An important thing to remember here though is that while #{primedItem} Prime relics were moved over to the Primed Vault and made inaccessible any relics that were acquired before these items were moved into the Primed Vault will stay. 

h2 How To Get #{primedItem} Prime
p So, first things first, check the presence of the following relics in your Void Relic Refinement:
ul
	each relics, itemPart in itemPartsToRelics
		- var thatDrop = relics.length === 1 ? ' that drops ' : ' that drop ';
		- var relicsList = '<b>' + relics.join(', ') + '</b>' + thatDrop + itemPart;
		li !{relicsList}

p If you don't have any of them then either you could buy #{primedItem} Prime relics from other players or wait until the #{primedItem} Prime eventually returns when the Prime vault opens again.

p And thatâ€™s pretty much all I want to say about #[strong How To Get #{primedItem} Prime]. I hope this guide helped and let's hope #{primedItem} Prime will be unvaulted again soon. Bye-bye.
